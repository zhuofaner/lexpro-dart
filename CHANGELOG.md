## 2.1.0

* support **Templates** extends JParse
    for better match for split text auto completing.

    - use `$`、`$1`、`$2` .. for variable injection in a template string.
    - support `variables extracting` from exited `tokens` or matches a `pattern` from the given split text.
    - support extracting failed basic variable value
    - if `enumnone` not given and extracting failed to match anyone, template rule with symbol `$` ignored.

* support `splitAutoCompleting` which can match split words that `autoCompleting` can not match
    
    - `wd40` split in letters `w` `d` `4` `0` **matches** width_40、width="40"、maxWidth_40、minWidth_40、 maxWidth="40"、minWidth="40"
    - if `length="400"` exists, wd40 also matches width_400

## 2.0.0

* support **Event System** to build your AST or directly do your stuff.
    
    * support self defined `LIFE_CYCLE`s and `onCondition`s Events

    * in `onRuleMatched` function will return a `Context` including newly added Tokens.

* support build Parsers from known **Constants**

* support DynamicToken create from **Enums** or **asEnum** to collect from parsed known message.

* support create pure **Library Lexer** only loaded in root Lexer's common part.

* support parse from a configgable **LexerMain** with a **Library Chain**

    * support static `dependencyAnalyze` with no parsers running.

* support **Auto Completing** from **Constants and Enums** reuse a cached runtime context.
(*not tested launched from other than **Lexer Main**)*

## 1.1.0+1
* bugs hotfix
## 1.1.0
* support **DynamicToken** which you can define your own Token.
* support **DynamicToken.from** to create from a exist Token like `DynamicToken.from(Token.Text)`, and they are equal in operator '=='
* if exist `.token` will return a Token on DynamicToken or else return **Token.Dynamic**
* example now is easier to learn, you can try your own Domain Specific Language on Dart or Flutter now!

## 1.0.2+1
* Add two utils tools function "RegstrInvoke" && "groupPureOrLinkCapture" for easy from string to call a function.
    
* Optimize implementation of ON && ONPOP function in core parsing block using the newly added function *RegstrInvoke*
    
* Try to build simple RegRules from RegstrInvoke to Dart Function for a short DSL instead of using Lexer.The latter one is too heavy.
## 1.0.0
    
* support Lexer parse inside Lexer by adding Parse.lexer factory constructor.

* add common parses rules which provide a public parsing rules.
    
* add pretty stingify method to make unprocessed tokens processed.
    
* add more POP methods to support nesting Lexer Parsing.

* add more tests.
    
## 0.1.0+1

* fix nextState(or newState) prop lost in GroupParse.

* add tutoring doc.
    
* add lexers/senior/dart_import.dart only for senior use show and test.

* add POPTO function in utils/poprouter.dart
